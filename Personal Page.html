        	There's nothing much to say about me except for the fact that I'm a short girl, (I'm 4'11", can you believe that?) and I'm basically just your average freshman. Taking in the fact that I can be loud and obnoxious sometimes, but hey, who isn't right? I prefer watching anime or reading manga rather than watching actual television shows on my tv. Like I said, there's nothing much to say. </p>
        
        <p style="font-size:13pt;color:black;font-family:Verdana"> I'm addicted to the internet, pouring more love into my computer or phone more than some things, except sleep of course. Some of the sites that I visit include: 
       	 <a href="http://www.youtube.com"> Youtube, </a> 
        	<a href="http://www.tumblr.com"> Tumblr, </a> 
        	<a href="http://www.netflix.com"> Netflix, </a> 
        	and many more! </p>
        	
 	<ol style="font-size:13pt;color:teal;font-family:Verdana">
    	  What I like to do:
    	  <li> The bands that I like listening to include Sleeping with Sirens, All Time Low, and many more.
            <li> I like to stuff my face with gooey, cheesy, delicious pizza. Who doesn't? 
            <li> When it comes to candy, I prefer something chewy and sweet.
	  </ol> 
   
    	<ol style="font-size:13pt;color:purple;font-family:Verdana"> 
     	  What I dislike:
         <li> Math is not my friend and will always be my enemy.
            <li> Exercising isn't my type of thing, although I do like to play volleyball.
            <li> I prefer to avoid eating vegetables, seeing as it doesn't taste too well to my tongue. 
    	  </ol> 
    
    	<ol style="font-size:13pt;color:maroon;font-family:Verdana"> 
          My Hobbies:
          <li> On my free time, I read sappy romance novels. I also write a bit too!
          <li> I love, love, love, tweaking on online games and I've grown up as a gamer.
          <li> Singing is something I'm not very good at, but I still do it frequently. 
    	  </ol>
